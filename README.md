# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts loan approval status based on applicant data using machine learning models. It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `loan_approval_prediction_updated.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, analysis, and model training.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `data/`: (You should include the dataset here or provide instructions to download it.)

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## 📌 Key Features

- Missing value handling
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Model comparison and selection
- Prediction on new data samples

## 📈 Sample Output

- Accuracy: Up to 82% (depends on data/model)
- ROC-AUC Score: Provided for model performance comparison
